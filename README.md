# Impacts on Society

## Synopsis

In this lesson plan I hope to equip students to navigate the impacts of computer science in their own lives and on society by examining the design features of apps that they frequently use. I will be teaching Algebra 1, Statistics, and Advisory in the upcoming 2022-2023 school year. I have plans to incorporate computer science in both Statistics and Advisory (no plans yet for Algebra 1) in the upcoming year; one possible outcome of this is broadening participation in computer science. In Statistics, I will have students analyze and display data using Python on the Google Colaboratory environment. In Advisory, I taught several lessons this semester on HTML, CSS, and Javascript and I will build on this experience in the upcoming school year. This document details how I plan to incoporate issues of computing impacts on society in this Advisory course.

### Course

#### Advisory 

This course is a daily, 30-minute period during which documents (mainly progress reports) are distributed, announcements are made, and students are given the opportunity to study. There are typically three lessons given per week covering topics that include school culture, school policies, college, current events, history, personal care, and digital citizenship. Students earn a grade for the course based on weekly deliverables, most of which, are related to one of these lessons. 

As stated in my education technology plan, all of my students have a school-issued Chromebook. My goal is to teach, on average, one computer science lesson per week. I expect to teach a 9th-grade Advisory class in the upcoming year. 

## Plan

### Learning Objectives

Describe the learning objectives for the class that relate to social impacts. Consider using Bloom's Taxonomy to identify the types of cognitive and/or affective outcomes (and their associated verbs): https://bloomstaxonomy.net/

Students will be able to identify and describe the “addictive” design features of popular apps.

### Learning Activities

Describe the learning activities and how they will be incorporated into the class. For example, will they include class discussion, written reports, homework, or exams? Will the activity be a one-time lesson or used multiple times in class?

#### Warm Up
How much time do you typically spend daily using apps on your phone? 
Does the amount of time you spend using apps on your phone negatively impact other aspects of your life (such as academics, finances, relationships, or sleep)? 
Do you think your phone and the apps you use on your phone are designed to get you to use it either more frequently or for longer durations of time?

#### Explore
Watch the following video (VOX, YOUTUBE.COM, 2/23/2018):It’s not you. Phones are designed to be addicting.

Do a search for “addictive design features” or equivalent topic. Peruse the results and read two of the linked resources. Create a list of “addictive” design features. Share your list with your partner or group. Update your list with any “addictive” design features that your partner or group shared that wasn’t on your list.   

### Assessment

Describe how you plan to assess the learning objectives described above.

Create a table with the list of “addictive” design features in the first column and the names of two apps that you use most frequently as headers of the next two columns. For each “addictive” design feature in your list, indicate if it is a feature of the two apps in their corresponding cells and describe how it is used to get you to use the app(s) either more frequently or for longer durations of time.

### Outcomes

Describe how your plan will facilitate diversity/equity/inclusion and help broadening participation in computing. Also describe how the course plan will help long-term goals in addressing computing impacts on society.
