# Impacts on Society

## Synopsis

In this lesson plan I hope to equip students to navigate the impacts of computer science in their own lives and on society by examining the design features of apps that they frequently use. I will be teaching Algebra 1, Statistics, and Advisory in the upcoming 2022-2023 school year. I have plans to incorporate computer science in both Statistics and Advisory (no plans yet for Algebra 1) in the upcoming year; one possible outcome of this is broadening participation in computer science. In Statistics, I will have students analyze and display data using Python on the Google Colaboratory environment. In Advisory, I taught several lessons this semester on HTML, CSS, and Javascript and I will build on this experience in the upcoming school year. This document details how I plan to incoporate issues of computing impacts on society in this Advisory course.

### Course

#### Advisory 

This course is a daily, 30-minute period during which documents (mainly progress reports) are distributed, announcements are made, and students are given the opportunity to study. There are typically three lessons given per week covering topics that include school culture, school policies, college, current events, history, personal care, and digital citizenship. Students earn a grade for the course based on weekly deliverables, most of which, are related to one of these lessons. 

As stated in my education technology plan, all of my students have a school-issued Chromebook. My goal is to teach, on average, one computer science lesson per week. I expect to teach a 9th-grade Advisory class in the upcoming year. 

## Plan

### Learning Objectives

Students will be able to identify and describe the design features of popular apps, then write a short argument on whether these features make them "addictive," "habit forming," or neither.  

### Learning Activities

I will be incorporating the learning activies described below into the class as part of a one-time lesson. 

#### Warm Up
I will have students complete a survey with the following questions as the warm-up activity for the lesson:
1. How much time do you typically spend daily using apps on your phone? 
2. Does the amount of time you spend using apps on your phone negatively impact other aspects of your life (such as academics, finances, relationships, or sleep)? 
3. Do you think your phone and the apps you use on your phone are designed to get you to use it either more frequently or for longer durations of time?

#### Explore

##### Hanging Hashtags
Students will independently analyze images similar to those that can be found on https://www.removed.social/series showing individuals who are "removed" from society. In small groups, students will write a hashtag for the images on a post it or Google Jamboard, which is shared with the class.

##### Word (Feature) Walls
Students will watch the following (or equivalent) video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUMa0QkPzns (VOX, YOUTUBE.COM, 2/23/2018: It’s not you. Phones are designed to be addicting). While watching the video, students will make a list of features with a short description of the each feature. The class will create a feature wall (like a word wall) that the students can reference.  

Students will also read one article on "addictive design features" or an equivalent topic. While reading, students will add their list of features with short descriptions. The class will update the feature wall.

##### Brainstorm Walk
I will prepare and post sheets of chart paper around the room, each with the name of one popular app (e.g., Instagram).

### Assessment

Describe how you plan to assess the learning objectives described above.

Create a table with the list of “addictive” design features in the first column and the names of two apps that you use most frequently as headers of the next two columns. For each “addictive” design feature in your list, indicate if it is a feature of the two apps in their corresponding cells and describe how it is used to get you to use the app(s) either more frequently or for longer durations of time.

### Outcomes

Describe how your plan will facilitate diversity/equity/inclusion and help broadening participation in computing. Also describe how the course plan will help long-term goals in addressing computing impacts on society.
